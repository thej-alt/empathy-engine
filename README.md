# The Empathy Engine 🎙️

The Empathy Engine is an AI-powered Text-to-Speech (TTS) service that generates emotionally expressive speech from text.  
Unlike traditional robotic TTS systems, this service detects the **emotion and intensity** of the input text and dynamically modulates vocal characteristics to produce more human-like audio output.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Emotion detection from text using sentiment analysis
- Supported emotions:
  - Excited
  - Happy
  - Neutral
  - Concerned
  - Frustrated
- Emotion intensity scaling
- Dynamic voice modulation:
  - Speech rate
  - Pitch
  - Volume
- Generates playable `.wav` audio output
- REST API built using FastAPI
- Interactive API documentation via Swagger UI

---

- **Python**
- **FastAPI** – API framework
- **NLTK (VADER)** – sentiment & emotion detection
- **pyttsx3** – offline Text-to-Speech engine

POST /synthesize

###Request Body :
```json
{
  "text": "This is absolutely amazing news, I am very excited about it!"
}
```

##🧠 Design Choices & Emotion Mapping

Emotion Detection

VADER sentiment analysis was chosen for its speed, simplicity, and interpretability.

The compound sentiment score is used to classify emotions:
| Compound Score Range | Emotion    |
| -------------------- | ---------- |
| ≥ 0.8                | Excited    |
| 0.6 – 0.79           | Happy      |
| -0.2 – 0.2           | Neutral    |
| -0.59 – -0.21        | Concerned  |
| ≤ -0.6               | Frustrated |

This separation allows the system to distinguish between strong excitement, general positivity, and mild concern, which is crucial for realistic voice modulation.

Intensity Scaling :

Emotion intensity is calculated as the absolute value of the compound sentiment score.

This intensity value controls how strongly voice parameters are modulated.

Voice Modulation Logic :

Each detected emotion maps to a predefined voice configuration :

Excited :

    Faster speech rate

    Higher pitch

    Increased volume

Happy :

    Slightly faster rate

    Moderately higher pitch

    Normal volume

Neutral :

    Default rate

    Default pitch

    Default volume

Concerned :

    Slightly slower rate

    Lower pitch

    Softer volume

Frustrated :

    Slower speech rate

    Lower pitch

    Reduced volume

This deterministic mapping ensures the system remains explainable, reproducible, and easy to extend.

##🔮 Future Improvements:
    -> SSML-based fine-grained voice control

    -> Real-time audio streaming in API response

    -> Transformer-based emotion classification

    -> Frontend UI with embedded audio playback.
